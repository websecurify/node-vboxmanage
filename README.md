This library provides a collection of functions to interact with VirtualBox via its command-line interface VBoxManage. The library is written in CoffeeScript for better readability and because if some idiomatic expressions, which make writting this type of code slightly easier and less error-prone. However, you can use the library from JavaScript just as well. See [Vortex](https://github.com/websecurify/node-vortex) as an example.

# Documentation

The library is self-documented with [closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler)-style comments embedded directly into the source code.
